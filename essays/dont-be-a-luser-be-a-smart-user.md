Write a technical essay that discusses why smart questions are important for smart software engineers, how the chosen questions fulfill (or not) the precepts  for smart questions, how the responses reflect the smartness (or lack thereof), and the insights you gained as a result of this experience.
You might be wondering why I spelt Loser wrong in the title.  If you are wondering, the answer is yes, I spelt it wrong on purpose.  It is a term that is relateable to what I am explaining in the next paragraphs.  Or maybe, you weren't wondering at all and did not care.  Anyway, Luser is someone who doesn't ask a "smart" question to higher level hackers or coders because they basically waste time on answering this Luser's question that could have easily been found in some source.  It is spelt Luser because you are a user and when you put loser and user together, it makes Luser.  What is a smart question? It is not a stupid question.  I have met some smart people in my lifetime, but they ask stupid questions.  A stupid question could either be worded very poorly or the answer can be simply found on some type of source available to the user.  I read this website article called [How To Ask Questions The Right Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) and I definitely feel like I leveled up in the coding world.  This feeling I have after retaining this information proves how important it is for smart software engineers to ask "smart" questions.  If you put a flyer up and someone comes up to you to ask when the event is, then you would either look at them like they're a Luser or get irritated because it's right in front of their face.  This is the same concept with asking questions towards higher level hackers/coders.  They have bigger fish to fry in their real world and they don't like to waste their time answering super simple questions that can be found elsewhere.
