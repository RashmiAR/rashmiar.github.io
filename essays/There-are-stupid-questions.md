## Weeding Out
 When asking for help from either a forum or a professor, it is important to intelligently. In comparison to high school where a teacher has enough time to help kids one on one, professors and online helpers have a lot more people to attend to. It is incredibly wasteful to ask a question that could have been answered elsewhere or solved through a few minutes of troubleshooting. The opportunity cost of answering your question is the time lost that could have been used to solve other's. We all had that experience as a student in primary school where a random kid in the class would ask a stupid question. But the teacher would always proclaim that there actually weren't any stupid questions. There are stupid questions, or following Raymond's guide, there are "loser" questions. Much like how a solution has to be worked through multiple steps, so must a question. The stackOverflow question I found did little of what Raymond had recommended. This is a prime example of a loser question. From the beginning this question seems easily accessible through a google search, and it was. Moreover, the question gave little thought into what he had tried to solve the solution, nor gave much information to portray his desire to learn the subject matter. It was brought up much like a homework question, as a dedicated learner would have most likely searched up a similiar question instead. Contrary to what Raymond said in his post, he actually was able to get multiple replies. Besides the replies, the downvotes and answers were very similiar to what Raymond had said. There was a comment claiming the simplicity, while the top comment was just an answer without an explanation.
