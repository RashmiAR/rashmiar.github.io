why use semantic UI, benefits? , why not just use HTML & css, personal experience, 
Semantic UI is the first UI framework that I've had the pleasure of learning and using in my projects.  So far I have learned menus, background photos, footers, grids, labels, icons, and much more.  I can honestly say that I enjoyed learning semantic UI because it is similar to a shortcut to creating better web designs.
