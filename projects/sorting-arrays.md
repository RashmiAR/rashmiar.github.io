   This is a more basic program where we write algorithms for the three sorts called Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort.  We were required to know the difference between the three sorts characteristic-wise and algorithm-wise.  I also used a comparator method in the sorts in order to compare the array items to see if they needed to be switched.  The purpose of the sorting algorithms is to put the list items in order either ascending or descending depending on what you want.  
  
   I think this was a good learning experience for me because it shows different ways you can sort a list and this is good for choosing which would be the best method for certain situations.  These aren't the only sorting algorithms that are available, but these are the basics of sorting. This was difficult to a point of tiny details that were missed.  This had to be flawless because we were going to implement these sorting algorithms in future homework assignments.
