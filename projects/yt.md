summary: The creation of my YouTube Channel

Ever since I first started playing computer games, and gaming content became popular I always wanted to put something online of my own. So I started a YT channel when I was in middle school playing a small building/creation type of game. It had a small following but a dedicated community. I was introduced to this game from another mobile game and I got hooked on it for a long time. The game itself was very simple as you created items by mixing other items, and then building much like a 2d minecraft. I decided that I would make some tutorials on Youtube. 

Although I believe my content creation was quite amateur I did get faimiliar in using programs such as camtasia and windows movie maker which albeit were not very great editing programs. I also got familiar with recording software such as OBS, and thumbnail or art creation through the use of paint.net. I don't believe that I made exceptional content but after a few popular videos I was able to get a small following, reaching to nearly ten thousand subscribers and getting a total view count of around 1,200,000.
